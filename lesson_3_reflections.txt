---When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If the project spans multiple computers, a remote repository provides a central location for all of them. (Which might or might not involve multiple developers - maybe you just want to work from home or a coffee shop).

A remote repository helps provide backup in case something happens to the computer(s) used for development.

If you have an audience, client, or other party who wants to watch development even if they may not be participating in it, a remote repository like GitHub provides a place for them to track progress. For instance: a public repository for an open source project, or a private repository for a client on a contract project.
